## Overview
The project includes a set of tabs, each containing a title, content, and an associated image. Users can switch between tabs using a list of indexes or by clicking on the tabs directly. The content is designed to be readable and interactive.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/nferdica/accessible-tabs
```
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. Explore the tabs by clicking on the tab titles or using the provided list of indexes.

## Structure
* __Indexes__: A list of indexes is provided for easy navigation. Each index corresponds to a tab.

* __Tabs__: The main section contains a list of tabs, each consisting of a title, content, and an associated image.

## Styling
The project includes a basic stylesheet (`style.css`) for styling the tabs. You can customize the appearance by modifying this stylesheet to suit your design preferences.

## JavaScript
The functionality of the accessible tabs is implemented using JavaScript (`script.js`). The script handles tab switching and ensures a smooth and accessible user experience.

Feel free to explore and modify the JavaScript file to add additional features or customize the behavior of the tabs.
